# MS-DAT203.1x-DS-Essentials-Python
After awesome lectures, some labs and assignments included in the course, I was missing more practical work, more assignments and more order and guidelines in the sea of available content from this field. Although course and curriculum is marketed as preparing for jobs in Data Science it is far from getting a job. What is missing is experience. The most practical advice I found was to start yourself a project as soon as possible, i.e. to start to build a portfolio. But how? When? That is why I created this notebook(s) to boost and harness the course into gaining more experience.
